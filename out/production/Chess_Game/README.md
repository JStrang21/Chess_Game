This project is intended to help learn about abstract classes and class structure in general. How to create classes with 
different responsiblities and hiding those responsibilites from objects which don't need to have access to them. This will 
give me practice in putting what I learned in OOP into use. I plan to learn Javafx in order to create a GUI for the game 
to make it playable. I created a new repository to start the project fresh because the previous project had issues with 
packages and build path that I couldn't figure out.

Started creating project in VScode IDE but switched to Intellij: created new git repository
